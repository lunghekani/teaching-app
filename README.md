// The Book class should have properties for title, author, and ISBN, as well as methods for getting and setting these properties.
// It should also have a method for checking whether the book is available (i.e., whether the number of copies available is greater than zero).

// The FictionBook class should inherit from Book and also have a property for the genre of the book 
//(e.g., "mystery", "romance", "science fiction", etc.).

// The NonFictionBook class should also inherit from Book and have a property for the subject of the book
//(e.g., "history", "biography", "self-help", etc.).

// Your task is to write a method that allows a user to check out a book from the library.
// The method should take as input the title of the book and the number of copies the user wants to check out. 
//It should update the database to reflect the fact that the specified number of copies are no longer available. 
//If the book is not available, the method should throw an exception.
